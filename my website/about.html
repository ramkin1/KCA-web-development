After earning his degree, Luca moved to the United States to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard University, where his research on ecological systems gained widespread recognition. Throughout his career, Luca's work took him to various parts of the world, including the Amazon rainforest and the African savannah, where he studied diverse ecosystems and their inhabitants.
